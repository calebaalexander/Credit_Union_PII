    "   - Column-level masking policies (PII data is masked for `data_analyst`)\n",
    "   - Row-level security (only San Francisco data for `data_analyst`)\n",

    "   - Role-based access control (RBAC)\n",

    "3. Each role has appropriate access:\n",

    "   - `data_analyst`: Restricted data access, limited models\n",

    "4. AI functions maintain data privacy:\n",
